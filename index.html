            <p>Kristian Vines is from Hobart, Tasmania. His student number is S3975623 and his student email is
              <a href="mailto:S3975623@student.rmit.edu.au">S3975623@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. Programming has been his passion for
              many years, and he considers it one of his primary hobbies. Most of his programming knowledge is self-taught, although
              he has some formal education as a former student for a Bachelor of ICT at the University of Tasmania. He hopes to
              complete his IT studies through RMIT online. His favourite foods are Italian and Eastern Asian dishes &ndash; mainly
              pizzas and spicy noodle soups. Outside of technology, his next biggest passion would be powerlifting, a sport he has
              participated in since 2016.
            </p>
            <p>Marek Ivanov is from Estonia and studied electrotechnology after Year 12. His student number is s3925058, and his
              student email is <a href="mailto:s3925058@student.rmit.edu.com.au">s3925058@student.rmit.edu.com.au</a>. He is a
              hands-on learner who enjoys tinkering with electrical instruments. He has had numerous careers over the years, and at
              34 years of age, he is looking for something stable to settle down with. He currently works at a model-making studio
              in Perth that produces realistic models utilising all sorts of technologies, from 3D sculpting in ZBrush to 3D
              printing life-sized sharks. He is unsure of where his studies at RMIT will take him, but he is eager to learn and
              interested in AI.</p>
            <p>Vanessa Wang is from Sydney, Australia. Her student number is s3930916, and her student email is 
              <a href="mailto:s3930916@student.rmit.edu.au">s3930916@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. She has worked several other jobs prior
              to her study at RMIT, such as a medical laboratory technician (MLT), and much of her former education is based on
              medical science. She also previously worked as a software engineer but had to leave the position due to conflicts with
              her personal life. She has a strong interest in cinema and has seen over a thousand films. She has been interested in
              IT since a young age, but parental pressures forced her to pursue medicine instead.</p>
            <p>Will Berger currently works as an Administration and IT operations consultant. His student number is s3697728, and
              his student email is <a href="mailto:will.berger@student.rmit.edu.au">will.berger@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. Since being
              first introduced to it in primary school, he has always had a strong passion for IT. He worked on countless personal
              projects, with his main interest in infrastructure design, implementation and deployment, including networking and
              virtualisation. He chose RMIT as it is an industry-leading educator when it comes to IT, and being able to do the
              course online works well with his work life. He believes it will be an excellent opportunity to learn the fundamentals
              of many different areas of IT. He is a beginner-intermediate level in Italian and owns a Siberian Husky named Mishka,
              whose favourite thing to do is to ride in his Jeep with the roof off along the beach.</p>

            <p>Logan Hosking was born and raised in Victoria, Australia. His student number is s3976923, and his student email is 
              <a href="mailto:s3976923@student.rmit.edu.au">s3976923@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. He graduated high school in 2011 at
              Catholic College in Bendigo and moved to Ballarat for university studies but realised this was not for him then. He
              worked in finance and real estate for a few years before working in Japan for four years, mainly teaching English. His
              time in Japan led to his developing an interest in technology as he formed friendships with people in the IT industry.
              His hobbies include consuming science fiction and fantasy media. He also follows the St. Kilda football club.</p>
            <p>Milla Kinnunen is a 26-year-old originally from Finland. Her student number is S3980991, and her student email is 
              <a href="mailto:s3980991@student.rmit.edu.au">s3980991@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. She has been in Australia for over
              eight years and is about to receive her citizenship. She has previously completed subjects through Open University and
              finished the Personal Training course. She can speak four different languages and can play the piano and violin. Her
              curiosity in IT was sparked when she worked at a job for accounting software and decided to make a career in it. She
              loves how the IT field has many opportunities and allows her to work from anywhere remotely. She chose RMIT because
              she wants the option of studying online and having the flexibility for her time.</p>
            <p>Owais Ansar is a 23-year-old currently residing in Canberra, Australia. His student number is s3980135, and his
              student email address is <a href="mailto:s3980135@student.emit.edu.au">s3980135@student.emit.edu.au</a>. Both his
              parents were born in Pakistan and moved to Australia in 1998, one year before he was born. His highest education was a
              Year 12 certificate in 2017. He speaks English and Urdu, and can read and write in Arabic. Fun facts about him are
              that he is double-jointed in both arms and can rotate them at almost 360 degrees. He is also a massive fan of
              Manchester United Football Club. His main interests in IT are cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and he can see
              himself working in them in the future. His interest in IT first came to him while studying at his previous university
              for a Bachelor of Business (majoring in Marketing).</p>

        <div class="even-columns">
          <div class="flow">
            <p>Kristian is an INFP-T, his learning style is visual, and he scored 120/200 on the ARealMe.com EQ test. He finds it
              difficult to grasp information verbally and prefers to read and have diagrams to grasp a complex idea completely. He
              does not believe that his test results will influence his behaviours in a team as he already has much experience from
              his previous work experience. However, he sees it as beneficial to know how to improve in areas where he is weaker.
            </p>
            <p>While forming a team, personality types should be taken into account. Marek is an INFP-A, his learning style is
              tactile, and the IPIP Big Five Factor Markers indicate him being more drawn to introversion with a high degree of
              emotional stability. His lower agreeableness and conscientiousness scores also indicate a greater level of impulsivity
              and disorganisation. He is someone who learns better from reading than listening. His personality is more inclined
              towards disorganisation and introversion, so a team should have a solid structure with all the roles made clear.</p>
            <p>Vanessa is an INTP-T, her learning style is visual, and the IPIP Big Five Factor Markers indicate her being more
              drawn to introversion with low emotional stability. She does not learn well from listening to others and would prefer
              to be delegated written instructions and to work on them in her own time. She finds working in teams complex due to
              her introversion but is willing to work on this skill deficit. She is highly driven and will aim to complete all tasks
              required of her before deadlines.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flow">
            <p>Logan is an ENTJ-A, his learning style is auditory/tactile, and the IPIP Big Five Factor Markers indicate him being
              more drawn to extroversion with a high degree of emotional stability. He believes he would work well with others who
              like to be active and practical about completing tasks. He states that he may disagree with others who exhibit
              leadership qualities, but at the same time, he hopes to work with people who can stand up to him during disagreements.
              As he takes a more tactile and methodical approach, he should aim to pair with more creative people, as that is his
              weakness.</p>
            <p>Milla is an ISTJ, her learning style is auditory, and her creativity test indicates that she is not very creative.
              Her advantage is to follow the duties required of her religiously. Her weakness is that she is naturally introverted,
              as she would instead work separately on tasks than collaborate in a group. The best setting for her would be getting a
              delegated job and completing it independently, only discussing necessities in a group setting.</p>
            <p>Owais is an ENFP-A, his learning style is kinaesthetic, and he scored a high level of agreeableness on the IPIP Five
              Factor Markers. He is skilled at improvisation, which can be good or bad in team environments. He can come up with
              solutions to problems but may also be too flexible that it would cause disruptions and make the group unable to follow
              deadlines. He is concerned about how agreeable the other people in the group would be to pursue collaboration. He
              believes that joining a team with a diverse range of skills and behaviours would be essential.</p>

        <p>The group worked well overall due to the desire on the part of everybody to collaborate and complete their part of
          the work. Technical difficulties and lack of availability to participate in some meetings due to other commitments
          were the main hindrance to collaboration. To mitigate this issue in the future, more clear meeting times in the future
          and communication through other means outside of meetings were established. Speaking more often in discussions among
          all team members has also increased after feedback from intra-group review was considered. These changes in the group
          process allow for greater coordination.</p>

        <p>Information Security Consultants are IT professionals responsible for implementing cybersecurity solutions to fulfil
          the needs of an organisation. Information security consultants have to perform duties to protect a business and
          educate the people within that business on the proper actions to take in various circumstances. Information security
          consultants may be required to demonstrate many certifications in addition to their degrees or experience, as their
          employment position carries a greater risk if performed inadequately.</p>
        <p>IT operations managers maintain control over IT services and oversee the functionality of the underlying network
          infrastructure and systems. Compared to the other roles, they are expected to understand networking and be more
          involved with hardware maintenance, such as ensuring proper ventilation or working out solutions to power outages</p>
        <p>Senior software engineers are highly experienced engineers who develop information systems by being able to resolve
          complex software issues, understand and build architecture, and can lead software engineering teams. Software
          engineers are highly diverse in their work and come from diverse backgrounds. Compared to the other roles, their
          primary responsibility is programming.</p>
        <p>Solutions engineers are IT professionals who interface between the business and clients. They have the technology and
          business skills to help communicate between the parties and implement solutions. The solutions engineer role differs
          from the others with its higher level of interpersonal and business skills required.</p>
        <p>These roles all differ, but the core similarity they share is that they require a lot of communication with others
          while working with technology. The IT industry has a reputation for being introverted and asocial, but in reality, a
          significant amount of teamwork and collaboration is involved. The solutions engineer must be capable with talking to
          clients; the senior software engineer must effectively work with other software engineers, etc.</p>
