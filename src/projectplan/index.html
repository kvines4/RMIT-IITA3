        <h1 class="fs-primary-heading fw-bold margin-bottom-400">Project Plan</h1>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Project Description</h3>
        <p>The project that we will dive deeper into in Assignment 3 is the app we presented previously in Assignment 2. Our
          project is a fitness-focused mobile app that will use your phone&rsquo;s built-in camera to watch you do compound
          lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts and analyse your lifting form. This app will be helpful for users
          interested in fitness and health and for beginners looking to learn the correct technique who cannot afford to get a
          personal trainer. In this case, an app would be great for learning the proper technique.</p>
        <p>Apps are a fast-growing trend in the IT industry; most people who have access to mobile phones use apps. Apps are
          easy to access and often free or very cheap to use. According to the Check Point State of Mobile Security 2021 report,
          many businesses are also looking to invest in security systems protecting app users from outsider threats. New
          authentication methods are being introduced, and instead of traditional passwords that are easy to use, other methods,
          such as security keys and passkeys in iCloud keychain, are becoming more popular. These two methods only work on Apple
          devices, making them only user-friendly for some.</p>
        <p>Another current trend is called &lsquo;Super Apps&rsquo;, which essentially is an app that offers solutions to serve
          multiple purposes. Instead of just an app that offers single solutions, the IT industry now vouches for apps that
          benefit users in different areas. An example is Facebook changing from a social media app to a marketplace and
          advertising app. Currently, Facebook users can sell used items on the marketplace, and companies can buy sponsored
          space on Facebook to promote their products or business. Another IT industry trend, e-commerce, took off during covid
          and has grown rapidly since. Mobile apps for e-commerce are taking over the original e-commerce websites, and
          e-commerce businesses have been forced to adapt to this change. If the companies don&rsquo;t jump on this trend, they
          will lose a lot of customers. Mobile commerce is user-friendly and easy to use, and it is crucial to ensure the
          business stays in the competition.</p>
        <p>Our group has varying interests; a few of us are interested in IT security, which would play a part in developing any
          app. As the app's popularity rises, so do the threats. An important consideration is focusing on information privacy
          laws and data protection, which should be part of developing an app. A few of the group members are interested in
          software engineering, and other areas of interest our group has are operations and solutions management. Software
          engineers can also build apps, as they have extensive knowledge of computer systems and developing computer systems.
          These skills help build web-based systems such as an app.</p>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Overview</h3>
        <p>Our idea is to create a fitness/strength training-focused mobile app that will use your phone's built-in camera to
          watch you do compound lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts and analyse your lifting form. This app would use
          real-time image recognition software to track information about the effort exerted in each lift. It will also provide
          insight into the centre of mass of the barbell and its motion over time; the user's body proportions, such as how far
          you are leaning forward and how deep your lift is. The application will then provide information on how safe your
          posture is. To analyse a user's form, we will use a scale of difficulty called RPE (rating of perceived effort) where
          zero would be at rest, five might be challenging to lift, and 10 is our absolute maximum weight lift. Server-side
          processing will be used for all information gathering and then displayed locally on the app on your device.</p>
        <p>Looking at the bigger picture, our project is designed to help users gain confidence in their ability no matter where
          they start. Whether you have been training for years or thinking about starting to train, our application will ensure
          that the exercises you complete are completed with the proper form and suitable weight to ensure positive results. We
          hope users can develop their fitness/strength training knowledge using our application. Creating this application will
          help users ensure they are not living a sedentary lifestyle and promote a healthy, balanced and active lifestyle
          instead.</p>

    <!-- Motivation -->
    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Motivation</h3>
        <p>The motivation for this project is to provide an app that would allow users who engage in weight training to perform
          safer and more effective exercises. As health science can be a confusing topic and exercise is potentially dangerous,
          it is essential to have an app that users can help to keep themselves informed. The digitalisation of the world and
          the use of technology to enhance productivity is in-line with current IT trends. The app would help people train users
          safely, which would result in reduced gym-related injuries. When performed correctly, users will also get more out of
          their workouts and improve their gym performance, leading to increased strength. Performance over time is tracked by
          doing a session of max lifts, and then in a few weeks, the user can repeat the max lifts and compare results. The app
          will also benefit users who train alone, as they cannot always rely on a coach. When the user exercises at the gym
          without a coach, the coach depends on the user's ability to track what RPE the user's heaviest lifts were to gauge the
          requirement to increase the weight each week.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Landscape -->
    <section class="margin-bottom-700">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Landscape</h3>
        <p>There are numerous fitness and health applications on Google and Apple App Store, which indicates market interest for
          such products. Popular gym-focused apps analyse workout data, like heart rate and calories burned, and are more
          general fitness guidance apps with scheduling and sample workout routines.</p>
        <p>From current gym-themed apps available, none of them have implemented exercise form correction as a feature yet. Poor
          exercise form is unfortunately one of the main contributors to weightlifting-related injuries. An application with
          such a feature would be beneficial to many beginners and even experienced gym goers.<br /><br /> Barbell tracking apps
          are used by weightlifters/powerlifters, and there are a couple of them already on the market. One of the most popular
          ones is WL Analysis by Karol Smolak, with over 50k downloads and a rating of 4.9 stars from 5. User reviews confirm
          that the app does a good job tracking the path of the barbell but does not offer lifting form feedback. The
          application screenshot in Figure 1 shows that the barbell motion leaves a trace that can be analysed further in the
          app. Data such as velocity, power, force, and horizontal displacement are available in the app for the user to
          analyse.</p>
        <div class="even-columns">

            <p><strong>Ai Fitness</strong>tracked body</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Another barbell tracking app with over 10k downloads is <strong>BarPath</strong> by David Nugent (<a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidnugent.barpath">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidnugent.barpath</a>).
          With BarPath user has to upload a video to get it analysed by app Ai system. From user reviews it stands out that it
          is not too user friendly as it converts videos to photos and saves each frame as a separate picture therefore making
          analysing videos longer than few reps too resource hogging. Also form correction is not offered in this application.
        </p>
        <p>Exercise form correction together with barbell tracking has not been implemented in any of the gym and weightlifting
          apps available.</p>
        <p>There are already couple of mobile applications using Ai technologies, such as image recognition and body movement
          tracking and prediction from camera feed, testing them indicated that the technology is there and can be implemented
          in our app idea.</p>
        <p><strong>FitYoga </strong>&nbsp;is a great yoga app that offers real time audio feedback about posture correctness
          while performing asanas. While following instructors&rsquo; movements from the screen, app also shows an indicator
          from 0-100% on a red-green dial of how correct your posture is following the routine. This is a great example of how
          AI can be used for real time workout tracking, in this case yoga.</p>
        <p><strong>FitnessAI</strong> is another app that uses motion tracking for repetition counting. It has large database
          with over 150 different motion tracked weighted and body weight exercises. Other features are nutrition planning, body
          measurement improvement tracking tools. To analyse exercise, form a video has to be uploaded via the app and it will
          be then analysed against the database exercises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Insane AI: Camera Workouts</strong></p>
        <p>This is a home workout application that has gamified workouts. The app utilised body motion tracking and user earns
          points, trophies and level ups while following exercise guide. Desired motion range is shown as a touch point on
          screen, user must reach for those zones to earn points while going through exercise program.</p>
        <p>The landscape for simple to use weightlifting application with posture correction and data analysis features seems to
          be favourable and other products on the market indicate that there is a need for such application.</p>

    <!-- Project Plan: Aims -->
    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Project Plan</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Aims</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project is "Learn correct form at the gym". Learning the correct from at the gym through an app has
          multiple steps to complete before the correct form is achieved</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Record yourself doing the exercise (squat, bench press, deadlift etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This part is a vital part of the app's functionality, as filming the user doing the exercise is going to give the app
          the data it will need to be able to analyse the correct form. The goal is that the user learns the correct lifting
          technique and will no longer receive notifications on how to correct their form, as it will be perfected while using
          the app.</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Wait for the app to analyse the video and read the prompts to correct the form</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this step the app will scan the video of the user doing the exercise and give prompts and tips for the user on how
          to correct their form. Such as, "keep your back straight", "keep your neck straight", or "point your knees out". After
          this the user would repeat step 1 and take into consideration the prompts the app provided and try to apply them in
          the next set. This step will provide information on the correct technique for the user so they can consider this in
          their next set. The goal is for the user to fix the motion while doing the exercise.</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Track your progress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app also provides an option to track the weight used and sets completed so that the user can follow their
          progress week by week and progressively overload to make sure they are making progress at the gym. The goal is that
          the user will continuously improve their performance at the gym by getting stronger and improving their technique.</p>
        <p>The most important steps would be 1 and 2, as the main idea of the app is to have the app record motion while the
          user is performing the exercise and analysing it, and for the user to correct their form after the app has finished
          the analysis. Step 3 is not compulsory and can be optional if the user wishes to track their strength progress.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <!-- Plans and Progress: Context -->
    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Context</h3>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">How it began:</h4>
        <p>Many apps are available today focused on health and fitness, with a handful being centrally focused around using a
          camera to analyse a person while they lift. The idea for our application comes from a noticeable need for features
          around safety and lifting technique as well as performance analysis, with the focus being on strength training and
          powerlifting. The current selection of apps available today are mostly focused on bodybuilding and/or yoga.</p>
        <p>Compared to bodybuilding where the main idea is to complete many reps at a lower weight to cause localized muscle
          damage that will promote muscle growth; powerlifting is about training the body to better activate your muscles to
          lift increasingly larger and larger weights. Due to the massively increased time spent lifting very heavy weights, a
          powerlifter is more at risk of hurting themselves if they lift with incorrect or outright dangerous technique.</p>
        <p>The main concepts involved in lifting safety are ensuring you always have a good centre of gravity, ensuring the bar
          follows a straight up and down path, and ensuring you do not arch your back dangerously when under load. These safety
          factors can be hard to keep track of when lifting close to your maximum weight, which is why many athletes will record
          their gym sessions for later review by either themselves or their coaches.</p>
        <p>By creating an app that focuses more on compound lift technique and less around tracking reps and calories, we can
          assist athletes of any skill level with ensuring they are always lifting safely at times when they do not have
          professional coaching available as an option.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when training at an athlete level, it is important to have back and forth feedback with your coach
          about how training is going between PT sessions and by tracking things such as the bar movement path and speed at
          various weights, we can provide coaches with a tangible way of measuring performance with statistics instead of from
          the athlete describing how they felt during the session.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">How it has progressed:</h4>
        <p>After the initial proposal of this project, we conducted many meetings to decide on the direction we are heading with
          the project and the approach we would take with its development. We have established indicative timelines that will
          shape minimal viable product versions for which we have made draft plans. We have also conducted challenge and
          forecast assessments to predict and allocate time for foreseeable challenges and considerations that will need to be
          undertaken as a requirement for this project to stay on track.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We have conducted extensive Research and development initiatives in order to facilitate a strong understanding of the
          types of systems that will be required to launch this project. This included research into cloud computing platforms
          that could be utilised to host a range of required servers needed for the app to function, including user database and
          machine learning data storage. Two notable research initiatives the team carried out include Cybers security and
          machine learning, which are obviously very strong forefront considerations that will be important for the deployment
          and launch of this service and be a crucial part of its success. Another essential aspect of this project that has
          been researched, although it will require extensive research for the deployment of this project, is the privacy policy
          that we will implement, which will stipulate our user data handling policy and procedures in accordance with General
          Data Protection Regulation. This law is set out by the European Union and is vastly interpreted as the global standard
          of data protection and privacy regulations.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">What stage of the plan you are up to:</h4>
        <p>In terms of the production timeline that we have outlined within this document, we have established the foundational
          groundwork for the project up to the Design and predevelopment phase. We have completed business analysis reports,
          including the competition/alternate applications on the market and a differential analysis outlining the differences
          our platform will have to these opposing options. We have conducted and outlined research and development pathways to
          lay out the roadmap with how this platform will be developed and launched publicly, with our minimal viable product
          versions and project milestones. We have also constructed fundamental plans and documentation for project continuity
          so that all project members are on the same page with the current state of the project and the direction in which it
          is projected to head. In addition, a member of the project team has drawn up some conceptual framework and design
          mock-ups that could be shown to a client or investor to demonstrate an interactive proof of concept with what the
          application could accomplish should it be developed. This also provides a starting point for the development team to
          start structuring the front-end and back-end of the app. This can expedite production as it allows the development
          team to initiate the app's construction whilst the design team works simultaneously to improve upon the user interface
          and user experience design.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Improvement from alternative apps:</h4>
        <p>Fitness applications are being used widely every day by millions of people. Our application differs from the ones
          available on the market by bringing together weightlifting posture correction and bar travel path analysis in one
          user-friendly package. None of the current applications on the market offers these two features together.
          Nevertheless, the weightlifting and fitness applications have come a long way and have implemented many beneficial
          features worth investigating in further versions of our application. Utilising wearable sensors adds another level of
          sophistication in data analysis possibilities. For example, heart rate offers a great insight into the overall
          exercise session. Fitness applications use heart rate to analyse how working out will have beneficial long-term
          effects on cardiovascular health. On the other hand, when a workout gets too intense abnormal heart rate notification
          could prevent causing damage to health.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To have the whole body in the frame of the camera whilst exercise is being performed, a mobile device got to be
          placed around 2 metres away from the subject. This creates a problem for the display screen because the size is
          difficult to read. Real-time audio regarding posture correctness can be helpful in this case. FitYoga application also
          uses a coloured dial from zero (colour red) to hundred (colour green) on display while exercise is being performed to
          indicate the correctness of yoga pose.</p>

          <h4 class="fw-bold">System Schematics and Deployment</h4>
        <p>The production of the application could utilise the Xamarin framework to facilitate the creation of the platform for
          both Apple and Android devices which could accelerate the production development timeline. This framework is provided
          by Microsoft and leverages .Net and C#, which are very common and easy-to-learn programming languages and are skills
          that are very easy to find in the workforce, which help with the process of hiring developers for the team.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cloud computing could be utilised through platforms such as Azure or Amazon Web Services to facilitate machine
          learning, storage and database servers as a requirement for the application to complement the end-user experience.
          These servers could be the barebone structure of the application's main features, including form tracking, user log in
          and social media connectivity. Video processing could be offloaded to one of these servers to analyse and compare data
          from previous datasets, which in combination with machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms, could be
          utilised to improve efficiency and data/statistical analysis. This aspect of the service could make use of
          Google&rsquo;s ML kit, which is a lightweight computer vision API that is designed for tracking the movement of the
          human body. Microsoft's Azure platform provides a service known as Azure Data Explorer, which can be used for instant
          visibility into very large raw datasets with near real-time analysis for identifying performance, trends, and
          anomalies.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Phase development </h3>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Planning</h4>
        <p>In the planning stage, we will create the road to follow in developing our application. The main things we will need
          to work out in this stage will be the timeframe, what features we would like to have in our application and the
          framework in which we will complete the application. Firstly, we will need to know the timeframe in which we feel
          comfortable building the application. This is important because there are so many different aspects of the application
          that need to be completed at the same time, and to make sure they all come together at the end, planning the timeline
          is crucial. Following this, we will need to decide what features we will need to have completed so we can launch the
          application. To bring a product to market, we will need to have at least 4 to 5 exercises so that our application can
          do as advertised. Lastly, we will need to plan the frameworks for our application. This will be the bones we build our
          application on, so it is essential to research the best technologies to create the best application possible.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Business analytics</h4>
        <p>This stage is where we will research multiple categories like competitors, demographics, market size, and anything
          that will help us make our application competitive in the marketplace. Business analytics is essential because if we
          do not conduct the research and find where our application can fit in the marketplace, we will not have a viable
          product to give users. With fitness applications being so popular now as people are becoming more health conscious, we
          have decided to fit the market of people looking for safety in the gym with our tracking software to ensure that they
          exercise safely and efficiently. The target demographic for our application is anyone who does compound exercises, as
          they will be the first exercises we make for our application. These people are commonly powerlifters and gym goers. As
          the health application sector is becoming increasingly popular and people want to look after themselves better, our
          application can stand out in this market.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Design and predevelopment</h4>
        <p>Design and predevelopment will be the first stage, where we develop ideas on what your application will look like and
          how our team believes we will accomplish this. We will create the colours, fonts, graphics, and necessary components
          that will make up the UI. Initially, in this stage, we will plan what type of experience we want our users to have and
          how we will deliver that through visuals. Once we have planned out what we want them to see, we create mock-ups and
          wireframes so we have a good idea of what the finished product will look like. Following this, we get to work on
          working out the best processes to make these come to life, and we can create an excellent experience for our users. To
          make sure our application is as attractive as possible we will have to be creative and make sure our UI is both highly
          intuitive and beautiful.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Ui design</h4>
        <p>In this project phase, we will see user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) developers coming together to build
          the application's structure and flow. This process includes aspects of how the application should look, therefore
          focusing on the style/design of the application and user experience. Important questions will be asked in this phase,
          such as what the application is meant to do and what differentiates it from its competitors. These solutions will be
          found through rigorous research on the fitness/training market, creating mock-up designs of the application, creating
          test prototypes of the application and testing the final product on real-life users. In this phase, developers will
          use PowerBI, Adobe XD, Figma, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to create the application. Some potential problems
          in this phase include a need for more communication between developers and designers. A lack of communication may
          result in the design of the application not being accepted and, in the worst-case scenario, the application not being
          able to do what it is required to do.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Pre-Development state</h4>
        <p>In this phase of the development, we will take the initial briefs and wireframes of the project and try to form
          tentative front-end objects. This will then help with the construction of the back-end development and kick-start this
          process. This phase will focus heavily on the initial planning of the different aspects of development, including but
          not limited to timelines, requirements, code segregation, and application features. It is crucial to ensure that
          timelines and requirements set by the pre-development team are accurate but, more importantly, achievable for the
          Front-end and Back-end developers. Failure to create accurate timeframes may mean that the project is pushed back,
          which may result in extra costs being added to the project to help carry the project forward past the set dates. It
          may also mean displeased developers and angry consumers waiting for the project. The application's features also need
          to be finalised in this phase. It will become a nuisance if the developers start constructing the application and are
          told that a feature is unnecessary or needs to be added now. Communication will be critical in this phase to ensure
          that the front-end and back-end developers receive the correct information to build the project.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Frontend and Backend development</h4>
        <p>During this development phase, the development team, which is comprised of backend and frontend programmers, work in
          conjunction with the user interface and experience design team to start to lay out the roadmap for how the app will be
          developed. This includes creating placeholder frontend UI elements so that the backend developers can focus their
          attention on creating the systems that will run the app itself before passing it back to the frontend team to change
          the placeholder text and establish connections between the frontend and backend. This process will go around in
          circles a bit whilst the two sections of the development team make progress and implement necessary changes for the
          app's programming. They will also have to make connections with the cloud-based computing systems and servers that
          will drive the interconnectivity of the app. The team will produce a minimum viable product which can be further put
          forwards to the executives for approval and enhancement to meet minimum requirements and stakeholder expectations
          before moving onto the testing and quality assurance phase to ensure that the app is optimised and ready for public
          release.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Testing</h4>
        <p>Testing the app is a crucial part of creating an app, as it will provide verification for the expected business and
          technical requirements. Testing of the app will be a process of analysing and validating it for functionality before
          it can be presented to the public users. To successfully test our app, we need to test the app in different operating
          system versions, screen resolutions and network bandwidths. This will ensure that the app functions perfectly across
          multiple devices. This is an essential aspect as mobile devices develop continually, so the app has to be able to
          function in the new advanced devices. App testing is vital for the business to ensure the app runs smoothly, as
          negative user experience can reduce profitability. App crashes can lead to an immediate deletion of the app and
          negative reviews, and optimising a positive experience for the user will lead to higher profitability for the
          application.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Potential challenges our app might face in this phase could be the video quality the user's device can record.
          Different devices have different quality videos, and varying screen sizes could be an issue. Today's customers have
          high demand on the functionality and easy use of an app, and our app could be questioned for the easy usability for a
          couple of reasons. Customers would need a high-quality phone camera, with a stable phone holder and the focus would
          have to be on the user doing the exercise, otherwise the video might get blurry.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Finalisation and launch</h4>
        <p>The people involved in marketing will have to build anticipation among the audience by promoting the product prior to
          the launch. If awareness of the product is prevalent, it will help to drive more sales before it is actually launched
          and curb loss of revenue. Have enough written and visual content available before the launch &ndash; such as
          descriptions, logos, and colour schemes decided upon. The first thing that must be done is to create an official
          landing page that is well-designed and enticing to the audience. To connect with visitors and keep them up to date
          with the product, the website must allow them to input their emails so they can receive updates directly. The
          utilisation of social media to connect with potential consumers and increase brand awareness is also necessary. Reach
          out to bloggers, journalists, influencers, and public relations representatives to create more interest in the
          product. Plan a launch party that will demonstrate the product to investors. Make it clear to the investors what the
          product is about and how it is unique or differentiated from other existing products. It will hopefully attract them
          enough that they can provide funding and awareness of the project so that it will become viable to expand its goals.
        </p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Support phase</h4>
        <p>Good handling of customer support will improve the public perception of a company, facilitate the continuous
          improvement of a product, and generate consumer loyalty to a brand. After the launch, check customer reviews of the
          product and take all criticisms into consideration. If people leave a scathing review, do not respond back with
          negativity but approach them with politeness and empathy. Provide a short-term solution to their immediate concerns
          and a long-term one about how the development team has taken note of their issues and will aim to improve the product.
          Customers can access support through means to ensure that they can make contact &ndash; such as live chat, email, and
          phone calls. It is preferable that their simple inquiries be handled through email and complex inquiries through phone
          calls. It can be challenging for employees to answer all incoming calls, and also quite time consuming for them to
          deal with calls regarding simple inquiries. It is crucial to provide a guide that answers the most frequently asked
          questions among customers as well as any other general information that is easily accessible. Customers will be
          instructed that they browse through these help guides first before they contact customer support as they may be able
          to resolve the issue themselves.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The idea for the app came from our group member Kristian, who presented this idea in his Assessment 1 for this
          subject. Our group decided to use Kristians idea for Assessment 3, as we liked his idea, and he also got one of the
          best grades out of our group members. During out meetings we have discussed the roles our group members are taking in
          the plan to develop the app, and we have discussed how we can present the app idea to outsiders and what are the steps
          to follow to make the app better.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Roles</h3>
        <p><strong>Project manager- Will</strong></p>
        <p>The project manager is a person who constantly oversees the progression of the project, assigns tasks to team
          members, and makes sure that deadlines are kept. As the application has multiple facets being completed
          simultaneously, they must make sure that everyone is on track to come together at the end. This is their primary role,
          to make sure there is team cohesion and that deadlines are met. This role is a must for our task as we have strict
          deadlines that need to be met and we have multiple members on our team who will need someone to manage the team and
          ensure the product is delivered on time. Will fits this role well, as his desired career path is IT operations
          management. This project is good for him to work on the skill required for the future.</p>
        <p><strong>UI developer &ndash; Will, Kristian</strong></p>
        <p>A User Interface developer works on how the application will look. They create layouts, and graphics, build mock-ups
          and take care of anything to do with visual design. Essentially anything to do with what the user will see or interact
          with the UI developer will have under their influence. They must have an intimate knowledge of design and be able to
          create an experience that is pleasurable to the user. This role is a must for any team building an application because
          if you want your product to succeed, it must look great and be easy to use. Will and Kristian both have product design
          and industry experience, so their role in user interface development will significantly support our project.</p>
        <p><strong>UX developer - Vanessa</strong></p>
        <p>A user experience developer creates application concepts, studies, and analyses potential users' behaviour, works out
          scenarios for task flows, outlines wireframes, makes prototypes, and follows a human-centric design. The experience
          users have with the application is controlled by the UX developer. They will research the habits of likely users to
          create the best experience possible with the product. The user's experience with the application must be smooth and
          intuitive to keep people interested, which is why having a UX developer is necessary for a project like this. We want
          to make sure to target the desired users and that their experience is enjoyable. Vanessa wants to deliver an
          exceptional experience to the users, and with her, we believe that the users will have an extraordinary time with our
          application.</p>
        <p><strong>Backend developer &ndash; Marek, Logan</strong></p>
        <p>Marek and Logan both show an interest in backend development and security. Their position as backend developers is a
          perfect fit, as they are eager to learn the technologies needed to complete the required tasks. The backend developer
          deals with the storage and security of the data, using APIs (application programming interface), building the
          frameworks and architecture of the application, using databases, managing IDEs (integrated development environment),
          and collaboration services. The backend developer handles everything behind the scenes, they make sure that the
          application works and all the different parts work together. Without a backend developer, the application would not be
          able to run, so this position is a must for our project. As the application will have server-side functions, we need
          to ensure the process works well to provide an excellent service to the users.</p>
        <p><strong>Business analyst &ndash; Owais, Milla</strong></p>
        <p>As we are building the application to be publicly successful, we will need a business analyst on our team to ensure
          our product is commercially viable. A business analyst researches market trends in the beginning stages of the project
          to see where the application will fit in the marketplace. By analysing business requirements and goals, they approach
          the development from a business perspective so that when the application is completed, it can perform well for the
          public and potential investors. Owais and Milla both show an aptitude for business analytics and will be excellent
          assets for helping us develop our project into something that will succeed in the marketplace.</p>

    <section class="margin-bottom-700">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Scope and Limits </h3>
        <p>The features we will prioritize for our application to make it deliverable to the public will be the motion tracking
          software done through the camera, having 4 to 5 pre-loaded exercises that the software can track quickly and
          accurately, creating the framework so the front and backend can communicate efficiently and smoothly, and making an
          attractive UI user interface to provide the user with a great experience. First, we would need to ensure that the
          application's primary function works. Therefore, tracking the exercises through the phone's camera and getting
          real-time feedback is a prime concern for us to deliver a viable product to users. Following this, we need to have at
          least 4 or 5 pre-loaded exercises so that we are confident the application can map and give the desired outcomes. Once
          these are completed, we will need to ensure the backend framework and user interface are completed. The user interface
          is what the user will see and interact with, so we need to ensure this experience is functional and enjoyable.
          Furthermore, the backend framework must be developed so the front and backend can communicate smoothly, as we will
          have server-side functions, which is a must. Once these are completed, we will have a viable base product to release
          to users.</p>
        <p>As we are limited in time, we would only be able to bring a minimum viable product forward. This means that we would
          only initially be able to have a few different types of exercises. We would then start with a limited number of
          exercises at the beginning. Furthermore, we may need more time to fully personalize the experience for each user by
          having workout plans, nutrition, and complete workout analytics built into the application. To ensure we have a viable
          product, we will be unable to scale the application depending on the device people use. As higher-end mobile phones
          will be able to capture and process the workouts much easier than older low-spec phones. We will have to initially
          release a one size fits all model to begin with. Lastly, as this is a personal project for the team, money will play a
          significant role in what we can bring forward.</p>

    <!-- Testing -->
    <section class="margin-bottom-700">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Testing</h3>
        <p>Testing is crucial aspect of software development and can directly affect all aspects of development from the speed
          of releases and to the overall success of a new release.</p>
        <p>The two main categories of testing are automated and manual testing. Manual testing is done buy a person who is
          actively using the app, often in the context of checking the overall user experience is good and assuring that the
          basic business requirements are being met from the perspective of those using the application. Automated testing
          typically refers to the many methods of using testing code to automatically check various aspects of your project from
          the results returned from your API&rsquo;s, the integrity of your validation code and the interactions between your
          different modules such as the front end connecting to API which in turn connects to the database.</p>
        <p>Unit Testing is the simplest form of automated testing we can implement and should always be added from the very
          beginning. Unit tests are typically pretty low level and are used to test code in isolation from the rest of the
          system; For example, if we have a function call that is meant to return a set of data based on a given user ID, a
          simple unit test we can add might pass in a valid user and assert that some valid data is received in return, or to
          pass in an invalid user id and assert that the error is handled properly and correct error data is returned. Unit
          testing can be done by a user running software on their local machine, but can also be tied into the build process
          itself; i.e., if any unit tests fail, the build process is halted and the engineers are informed. This will be our
          main form of testing in the early stages of development while building our API.</p>
        <img src="/images/plan-testing-1.png" alt="" height="500px">
        <p><em>Figure 1: An example of a function with its associated Unit Test and its result</em></p>
        <p>Integration tests and Functional tests have a broader focus than unit testing. For example, if we have an application
          which is installed on device X, which connects to an API that is hosted on server Y, which then connects to the
          database hosted on server Z, we need to know that all of these modules are talking to each other successfully. This is
          where integration testing comes in. Functional testing on the other hand is more focused around the overall
          business/user experience and whether the output matches what is expected during typical use and less so on the state
          of individual modules.</p>
        <p>A further extension of functional testing is end-to-end testing. This is meant to completely replicate how a user
          would experience the application and can be either manually tested or done automatically. A typical end-to-end test
          might be to open the application and log into your user account. Open pages x,y and z, change some settings and then
          make a post. End-to-end testing is a lot harder/more expensive to maintain as an application evolves. In the early
          stages of development, these jobs will typically be small enough that they can be done manually by the developers as
          they build the functionality, but as complexity grows and the project matures, we will need to start automating some
          of this process and have some dedicated testers.</p>
        <p>Another important aspect of testing a large-scale project is performance testing. How many users are using the
          application at once? How many API calls are made in a typical session on the app? And how many of these calls are
          doing read or write operations to the database? Performance testing answers a lot of these questions with a good
          degree of accuracy and allow for proper planning/maintenance of networking infrastructure. A fantastic example of a
          great performance testing tool is Microsoft Azure&rsquo;s Monitoring tool, which has features such as Application
          Insights, Log Analytics and VM Insights.</p>
        <p>The Azure Monitor tracks and analyses all telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments and uses tooling to
          provide helpful real time information and advice on where bottlenecks are, which resources can be expanded such as the
          number of VMs running your services. It can also build up a visualisation of all the components of your project and
          provide information on how the interact with each other,</p>
        <p>Performance testing like this is an important stage to keep in mind as we are developing our infrastructure. We
          don&rsquo;t want to undercut the performance of our application to save money on resources, but we also don&rsquo;t
          want to fire up too many unnecessary VMs if we don&rsquo;t need to. Performance testing will be done from the
          beginning as we start to build up our testing environments and move into production.</p>

        <p><em>Figure 2: Azure Application insights showing application map</em></p>
        <p>Something we can&rsquo;t forget during development is that this application needs to easy to navigate and fun or
          interesting to use. It does not matter how great your product is, if it is painful to use, people will not make use of
          it. It will be very important in the early stages to test our designs on our target demographic.<br /> &nbsp;Initially
          we can rely on family and friends who use the gym to test our product for us, but as we move past the
          &lsquo;alpha&rsquo; stage and into &lsquo;beta&rsquo; we will likely need to reach out to actual users. <br /> Our
          plan for beta testing and getting initial interest in our product is to reach out locally to nearby gyms and weight
          lifting clubs. We can offer them X months of free usage and in return they will help us test the application and
          provide feedback. This is a win/win as they get free usage of our product and we get in return real feedback from our
          target demographic as well as potentially building an initial user/fanbase.</p>

    <!-- Risks  -->

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Risks</h3>
        <p>With anything in life, a certain amount of risk is involved in any action, and when it comes to creating our project,
          it is no different. Therefore Risk management is key to ensuring our project is a great success. Common risks such as
          computers breaking down, software not working properly, and staff health issues are generic risks. These risks will
          still affect the project, however below are the risks that are more relatable to our project:</p>
        <p><strong>Creating an application that does not work:</strong> As we have promised to overdeliver in this project with
          the features we have, we must be able to create and run the features we have promised our users and investors. If the
          application fails to have the features we promised, it will pose a significant threat regarding how profitable and
          usable the application is.</p>
        <p><strong>Poor UX/UI</strong>: If we can integrate our promised features into the application, this will be great;
          however, the application needs to run the software for the application in a timely and smooth manner. Failure to do
          this will result in an application that is buggy and slow, which means users will less likely use the application and
          leave bad reviews for it. This will then bring the profitability of the application, which will displease users and
          investors. In the UX/UI development phase of our application, the developers must spend time and effort creating a
          smooth and bug-free application; otherwise risk facing the consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Data security risks:</strong> When storing data and especially user data, we must outline security measures
          to avoid any data breaches through cyberattacks or internal leaks. Therefore the project team must involve
          cybersecurity specialists to constantly patch the software, protect the IT infrastructure and its assets and also
          monitor any data breaches. Failure to do so means that we lose important user data to cyber-attacks, which will result
          in a loss of trust from users and investors and essentially ruin our project.</p>
        <p><strong>Injuring oneself while using our application:</strong> As our project is based around the health and fitness
          industry and requires users to perform exercises, we will need to create extensive terms and conditions, which users
          must agree on before using the application. This is because if a user is to hurt themselves using the application,
          they may be entitled to compensation from us as we are informing the user on how to do an exercise. If the project is
          taken to court for injury compensation, it may result in the project going bust for the payout/s.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Group processes and communications  -->
    <section class="margin-bottom-700">
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Group processes and communications </h3>
        <p>Our group has chosen to communicate through Microsoft teams with clearly structured 30-minute to 1-hour long
          meetings. Attendance at these meetings, held weekly, often on Wednesday, is the absolute bare minimum requirement that
          our group has set as a compulsory standard. In the initial project meetings, requirements are run through all together
          as a group with an outline of delegated tasks and responsibilities are discussed and documented so that the entire
          group is on the same page. In conjunction with this, the group discusses and agrees upon a set timeframe and timeline
          of tasks and when they can be expected to be finished. We set firm midway project check-in where 50% of the project is
          required, a soft check-in date where the project is set to be finished and then we have the final deadline as a
          worst-case submission time if anything needs to be fixed up. These meetings are recorded for members that were not
          able to be present, with an automatically generated transcript also available. At the end of each meeting, Will goes
          over the meeting notes and outlines the updates in weekly delegated responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we also use a group chat on Microsoft teams to communicate with each other about any updates,
          questions and concerns we might have. This space also facilitates informal contributions to documents that can aid in
          improving the document or provide further context for the other group members to help contribute to their delegated
          sections and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Should there be a member of the group that is found to not be pulling their weight or completely fails to meet
          expectations by primarily the midway check in but also including the soft due date, mitigation by a third-party
          representative is sought out to help provide a solution. This process is aimed to be sought out shortly after the
          midway check-in if the group member has failed to meet expectations and/or the group has lost communication with said
          member. That being said, if this were to happen, the ideal scenario would be that the group member is reminded and
          notified of the expectation and requirements agreed upon at the start of the project. They are then given 24-48 hours
          to meet requirements without a group representative having to reach out to a third-party representative. In the event
          of unexpected loss of communication with a group member, a group representative is to attempt to make contact at
          minimum by a private message on Microsoft Teams and via email to the member's student email before seeking alternate

        <p>All work is to be produced in the shared drive that all group members have access to and is stored in the cloud for
          version history. Within this drive, the group members are to work solely on the specific projects master document and
          house any files/attachments in folders within the shared drive. This provides the entire group with the same content,
          file history of members' contributions for tracking changes, and redundancy from a single point of failure. The excuse
          of losing work that was not saved within the drive is not accepted and is rejected by the group as in the case the
          member has failed to follow production procedure as agreed upon by all members of the project.</p>
