        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Kristian Vines:</h3>
        <p>At the start of semester, I was dreading having to do group work assignments due to past uni experiences, but I was
          pleasantly surprised by how smoothly things went this time around and how well we managed to work together. Assignment
          2 we weren&rsquo;t perfect but by assignment 3 we managed to work out our communication issues and perform better. We
          probably could have done better to stick to our soft due by dates, but it is understandable as many of us do have
          commitments outside of uni and we have still managed to be done by actual due dates.</p>
        <p>Our team worked as we were all willing to assign each other work and complete things assigned to us by others. Having
          a variety of experience between members we were each able to take sections of the assignment that best suited our
          skills.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Logan Hosking:</h3>
        <p>Looking back on this assignment, I think that the team worked well at completing it because everyone was
          knowledgeable about the subject and willing to complete the sections assigned to them. We were also able to come
          together and complete most of the tasks well before the due date so there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of stress put on people.
          The one thing I thought that could be improved was communication. If we were able to have more team meetings it might
          have made the project easier to complete. The thing that surprised me the most is the amount of planning that goes
          into completing a project like this. I also didn&rsquo;t think that working in a team would go so smoothly. I learned
          about working in this group and how easy it is to collaborate with people on a project using tools like teams.</p>
        <p>Marek Ivanov:</p>
        <p>Having done this project as a group from start to finish was an insight to the field of IT for everyone in the group.
          There are always new technologies emerging, our mobile devices are capable to do so much these days and Interstaters
          project idea touched on that point. Making gym weightlifting safer for everyone is a worthwhile motivation for all the
          members of the group. Our team came together to explore the technologies and solutions on the market and demonstrated
          how to bring machine learning with image tracking to end users with a user-friendly application idea and mock up. As
          not all the members had much prior experience with mobile application development more knowledgeable team members
          helped to keep project on track with providing newcomers in the field of IT with valuable lessons about current
          workplace best practices. This group project has been a good learning experience and has demonstrated that the
          materials covered in the course had a beneficial effect on my knowledge about Information Technology.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Milla Kinnunen:</h3>
        <p>I think our group worked great throughout this assignment. Our group work has improved over the course, and we
          managed to finish the assessment on time with all the required details and sections we had to complete. I personally
          thought I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy group work but have enjoyed working with this group. What could have improved is for
          some of us to keep up with our soft due dates. I was surprised how well we managed to work through this assessment and
          delegate sections to each other. I was also surprised how easy it was to navigate with each other especially doing
          everything online, and everyone was always available for nearly all team meetings that were often held at a late time.
          This group work has been a pleasant experience for me</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Owais Ansari:</h3>
        <p>The group has improved drastically in all aspects compared to how the group was when it first started. This is
          because we are now all familiar with each other compared to when we did not know anyone at the start of assignment 2.
          I think our communication between peers was the best aspect of the group, everyone was noticeably clear in explaining
          their parts of the assignment and when it came to organising Microsoft Teams meetings everyone would reply promptly.
          One improvement that I would like to see from the group is making sure that we all clearly read the outline of the
          assignment, as for Assignment 2 we missed a crucial section of the assignment which resulted in the loss of marks. One
          thing that surprised me was how well we were able to get all our assignment parts into the master document and ready
          for submission. I thought that since we all live in different states there might be some problems that may arise, but
          to my surprise, we did well in making sure everything was completed. One thing that I have learnt about the group is
          that the group works well together, this is due to the fact that we have group members with various levels of IT
          experience which was great for our group assignments.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Vanessa Wang:</h3>
        <p>The team worked far more cohesively and with clarity in this session than what had transpired in the previous group
          assessment. The team used soft due dates and had a higher level of meeting attendance compared to the first. These
          changes helped to keep the team on the same page and became far more effective. The first group assessment provided
          experience to this one and mistakes that were present back then became key points of reflection in this session. The
          team came to understand how to resolve the issues that arose back then to avoid or mitigate them in the present. I
          usually do not like group assessments but everybody understanding their delegated roles and having the motivation to
          complete the task at hand made it a positive and informative experience. These assessments provide vital skills to
          become a more well-rounded person.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Will Berger:</h3>
        <p>I think we as a whole worked really well together for this assignment and assignment 5. I think the workload was way
          more balanced than what it had been in the past and everyone did their best to get work completed in a timely manner.
          Communication improved with a set structure of meetings and very clear expectations on what was required and when it
          had to be completed by. I was quite surprised with how well this group worked together to get these assignments in,
          theres been no major conflicts or arguments or even heated discussions so it was quite pleasant compared to previous
          group assignments. The wide range of knowledge and experience in the IT space made these assignments so much easier as
          well as we all shared knowledge and experience with one another. One thing I have noticed that we could all as a group
          is a bit more attention to detail and making sure we don&rsquo;t miss small things like we have in previous
          assignments purely because we just skimmed over the requirement brief.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Interstaters:</h3>
        <p>We as a group we have seen a very large improvement from when we first started and we were all pleasantly surprised
          and impressed with how well we worked together with very little hassles in completing assignments. The communication
          between peers was the best aspect of the group, everyone was noticeably clear in explaining their parts of the
          assignment and when it came to organising Microsoft Teams meetings everyone would reply promptly. This meant that
          delegated tasks were being completed much quicker and without anyone having any major issues which resulted in our
          group work has improved over the course, and we managed to finish the assessment on time with all the required details
          and sections we had to complete. Everybody having a very clear understanding of their delegated roles, the
          requirements needed to be met with these tasks and having the motivation to complete it at, made it an increased
          positive and informative experience.</p>
        <p>Our team worked as we were all willing to assign each other work and complete things assigned to us by others. Having
          a variety of experience between members we were each able to take sections of the assignment that best suited our
          skills. The wide range of knowledge and experience in the IT space made these assignments so much easier as well as we
          were all able to contribute to shared knowledge and experience with one another to help others when possible, to
          complete their section of the assignment. Another challenge we predicted to have but didn&rsquo;t end up being a
          factor was that we were all living in different states with some at one stage being international. We anticipated
          issues with meeting availability due to time zone changes but to our surprise, we did well in making sure everything
          was completed and most meetings having decent attendance.</p>
        <p>The team came to understand how to resolve the issues that arose back then to avoid or mitigate them in the present.
          I usually do not like group assessments but everybody understanding their delegated roles and having the motivation to
          complete the task at hand made it a positive and informative experience</p>
        <p>The group could improve on is despite many of us do having commitments outside of Uni and still managing to be done
          by actual due dates, sticking to the soft due dates that we all agreed to so its less last-minute stress trying to get
          it done. Additionally, clearly reading the outline of the assignment, focusing more on attention to detail and making
          sure we don&rsquo;t miss small things like we have in previous assignments purely because we just skimmed over the
          requirement brief and missed a crucial section of the assignment which resulted in the loss of marks.</p>
